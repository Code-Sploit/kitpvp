# kitpvp
A kitpvp mod for MineClone2

# Commands
To get kits use: `/kit <kitname>`.<br>
You can also run: `/kit list` to list all available kits.<br>

# Adding kits manually
If you want to add kits yourself then open the file named `kits.lua` and add your own kits.<br>
In the top of that file is explained how to do this :).

# TODO
    1) Add support for effects
    2) Add more kits (Suggestions wanted, post them in format of Issues)
